<h2>Mind over matter</h2>
<p>I just spent 1-and-a-half hours calming myself down from a panic attack. Only about the first 30 minutes were bad, the rest of the time I spent typing out this thought-stream for how to deal with similar occasions in future, or anything really. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdtHNfPyi_U">Survival Tactics</a>.</p>
<h2>Where u think yr goin boyo?</h2>
<p>Isn't it crazy how much our minds - or at least mine, is both willing and able to go along with generating noises, visual cues, or generally just leading you down the path that you are expecting or paranoid about or looking out for? </p>
<p>I just experienced this as I was sitting on the floor, shaking, thinking about and expecting <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pay_the_piper##Verb:~:text=experience%20unfavorable%20consequences%2C%20especially%20when%20the%20payment%20or%20consequences%20are%20inevitable%20or%20a%20result%20of%20something%20one%20has%20enjoyed">the piper to come knocking</a>. When I closed my eyes I swear I could hear the lock-noises, yet I heard no door open.</p>
<p>So I collected myself trying to still the subconscious part(s) of myself. My mind cleared up pretty quick so I stopped myself going down a rabbithole of paranoia - which <em>almost never</em> ends well. Some times you're right though, but the lesson still stands: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FAkQm6uxR4">Don't lose ya head</a>.</p>
<p>(While not having tested this in practice, if you are having trouble clearing your mind in the moment, try to quickly figure out what would make you feel safe - or what would alleviate whatever ill that's holding you back. If there's no harm I doing it - do it! Then focus on reigning yourself in again. Â¡Tell me why this wouldn't work?)</p>
<p>Thinking about it further this really goes for absolutely everything, I think. Why wouldn't it? Your brain interprets inputs and patterns all day and to save on processing power in the moment, or to react faster and more accurately, it will do some pre-calculation and and be ready to instantly and instinctively react to probable situations that your conscious is feeding your subconscious. Thinking about it like this makes it quite obvious that your brain will then make what your conscious mind is focusing on the most into the most pre-calculated or detailed instinctive signal to send back again. Do you think <em>you're</em> in control?</p>
<p>A side note though relevant one is that as I was thinking of a situation where logic and prediction is used in everyday life, a job interview was the only thing I could think of that made sense, and I noticed that my brain was somehow fighting to stick within that context.</p>
<p>This is likely as I currently have no job, know I must get one, and have here and there both awarely and unawarely alike (I suppose) gathered patterns from previous interviews and applied them within my general understanding of the process. This makes the job easier should you suddenly be in a situation akin to that which is already mapped out and ready, though it is even more powerful if you carefully think through the most likely events and even down to the outcomes. Make and pick the most probable outcome, the most detailed.</p>
<p>So think those very uncomfortable thoughts through until the end, as many times as necessary, until you no longer fear it - which is a combination of your practiced battle tactics in the moment, what you have thought through, and entropy, or God - whatever you want to call what is not up to you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mapping out this process has helped alleviate some fear that I have had recently. In a moment an instinctive reaction and going into a certain state if mind I remind myself of what you have just read and calming my monkey brain down by easing into something more calm and mindful. What I find helpful is having a mantra or keyword that you associate with a large amount of data. Or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism">aphorism</a> (which if I were intelligent I'd make this post into). Might I suggest:</p>
<p><strong>"Que Sera, Sera"</strong></p>
<p>Which is French for:</p>
<p><strong>"Whatever Will Be, Will Be"</strong></p>
<p>When at beginning, middle, and end of an event where these neural pathways are required I repeat the mantra to myself. The more you practice the stronger these connections become, until it's second nature (you can stop reading now).</p>
<p>Music is extremely important to me, as texts with meaning is what taught a literal autist how to become human (or at least the pretense). Connecting both an emotional state (music) and knowledge (lyrics) to your keyword makes it even more powerful. Feel free to skip this.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKumQCTNJOY">Doris Day - Que Sera, Sera</a> - As a mother would</strong> soothe your ills and teach you how to overcome. <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I18_VNjX3g">Wax Taylor - Que Sera</a> - The world will</strong> remind you to not be a little bitch about it - won't be alright if you don't make it so. <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaPQsYqNDnY">Big L - The Enemy</a> - No dad ("?" || ", no!")</strong> (trigger warning btw).</p>
<p>With this new understanding, or at least supposition based on my current knowledge and wisdom- This is a superpower. Wow, I just invented meditation and Om, as in "Oooommmmm". Genius. Love re-inventing the wheel.</p>
<p>Add another lesson to the lecture, stop being a stoopid free-thinker and tap into the timeless wisdom of the ancient philosophers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">The Lindy Effect</a>. Now that that I know nothing and stand at the cusp of everything, I will still need to be smacked by life repeatedly. But at least I'm leaving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a3-1TgyB6k">Breadcrumbs</a> in high definition.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the shitshow, and if you're also on the low, remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNRxKFEkjbo">No Time</a> to waste.</p>
